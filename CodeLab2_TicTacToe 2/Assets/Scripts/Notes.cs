 Chapin helped me at code helpdesk 
 
 I got it to put an O on the screen but it doesn't go where it should and I haven't tried getting it to swap to x. 
 
 
 -------------
 Things to make Tic Tac Toe: 
 
 Need a grid
 put X and O in grid 
 X sprite and O sprite 
 Grid sprites (board)
 
 Cant put an X or O in an occupied grid space.
 //this isn't really necessary if both players are paying attention but would be good to prevent overlapping accidentally. 

 Swap X and O every turn.  
 
Are there 3 in a row?
Go through grid and find adjacent marks of the same type. 3 across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. 

 //when you instantiate you need to give it a rotation, usually quaternion identity.
